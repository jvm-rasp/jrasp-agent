## 01 Project introduction [中文说明](README_ch.md)

_Java Runtime Application Self Protection_ means Java application self-protection system, which is called 'jrasp' for short.

jrasp-agent is the core part of jrasp project.

jrasp-agent based on Java Agent technology, modifies Java bytecode, adds security detection logic, detects and blocks vulnerability attacks in real time.

## 02 Characteristics

### Functional characteristics

- Security plug-in can be customized
- Detection logic low delay
- Plug in Hot Update
- Java Process Identification and Automatic Injection
- Support native method hooks such as command execution to completely prevent bypassing;
- Compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux
- Small size, core jar package 600KB

### Performance
- Increase CPU by 5% (test under normal request)
- Memory consumption below 200MB

### Self security

- Plug in and daemon HASH verification
- Agent and Daemon socket customized communication protocol and RSA asymmetric encryption;
- The core functions are loaded by custom class loaders and isolated from business classes, which improves the difficulty of attacking RASP from within the JVM;
- Reflection reinforcement: RASP core methods (such as unloading, degradation, etc.) reflect reinforcement to prevent malicious reflection;
- Do not use third-party frameworks, such as servlet, json, sl4j2, apache common, etc
